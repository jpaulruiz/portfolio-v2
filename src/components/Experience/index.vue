      Hi! My name is John Paul Ruiz, but my friends call me <span>Royce</span>. 
      I have been coding since my university days. Since then, it has been part of my life, and I am having fun with it.
      Move along, I have had the opportunity to work with one of the biggest point-of-sale system providers in my country. I have developed several features and designed system flows.
      <br><br>
      Currently, my focus is on web development (Full-Stack Dev).
      Since then, I have been developing new interfaces to building APIs catering the needs of customers and clients.
      <br><br>
      BTW, I go to the gym during my leisure time or play DOTA 2.
